In Capital Volume One, Karl Marx examines surplus-value resulting from the production process. While Marx argues that the means of production cannot create surplus value in the production process , he never considered the possibility that it could. Today, scientific advancements introduce a level of technology that is ‘automated’, in the sense that the way they provide value is not dependent on labor power. In this paper, I take the Neural Network as an example that proves the need to extend Marx’s theories on constant capital. Ultimately, I argue that as technology improves, the exploited class will be machines, not laborers.

Marx states that surplus value is a function of labor power, not means of production . In the capitalist mode of production, capital valorizes itself in every production process. The excess value generated, which is the value over and above the exchange-value of labor power and means of production, is surplus-value . It is in the capitalist’s best interest—as the one who owns the means of production—to maximize surplus-value, as it translates to profit. Marx states that the means of production cannot add to surplus value, but labor power can preserve the value of the means of production while creating new value . He then defines constant capital as the part of capital that does not change in value in the production process , and variable capital as the part of capital that alters in value in the production process . In Marx’s analysis of the means of production, he only considers its devaluation and thus ignores its value-generating possibilities. Assuming an aggregate of all production processes with average productivity levels , Marx argues that the value of means of production is never lost but is instead transformed. The transformation of the use-value from satisfying one human need to satisfying another is facilitated by labor activity, which—if it exceeds the necessary amount for a worker’s subsistence—will produce surplus value. 

Using the Neural Network as the basis for our analysis, surplus-value may be a function of the means of production, as well as labor power. The Neural Network complicates the duality of labor power and means of production, indicating that perhaps these are not mutually exclusive categories in the production process. This complication allows me to claim that the means of production can not only create surplus-value, but also it could create infinite surplus-value. The Neural Network consists of a series of computers that can make intelligent predictions based on a given set of data. The Neural Network is a commodity, like all commodities, with a use-value and an exchange-value. However, its use-value—making intelligent predictions and ‘self-learning’—creates value in and of itself. A Neural Network could provide an infinite number of predictive networks that serve as the means of production to an infinite number of products across an infinite number of industries. Although Neural Networks are materialized as computer hardware, the maintenance of computers are finite contributions of labor power that are negligible to the overall value created by Neural Networks. This is because the labor-time spent on maintenance—of hardware and software—is a bounded quantity, which makes the life-time of a Neural Network finite. But, the surplus value that the Neural Network could create is an unbounded quantity as no labor-power could be directly attributed to its output, which is what makes the Neural Network different from previous technological innovations. The difference is its ability to create value without additional labor-power; therefore, we can claim that the surplus-value generated by Neural Networks is infinite. The following example makes this clearer. Let us compare a fully booted computer with a fully primed—ready-to-go—Neural Network. In both cases, labor is required for the initialization of the product, which, like maintenance, is negligible in our calculation of surplus-value. If the computer is on but no additional labor-power is added, no value can be created; whereas the Neural Network is capable of ‘self-learning’ and training an algorithm that creates value. The Neural Network is materialized as a network of computers with finite life-times, but its use-value is not limited by the capabilities of labor-power, and thus, the Neural Network can create infinite surplus-value. The model for value being ‘infinite’ is nonsensical, and I argue that this error spawns from Marx’s segmentation of the production process—means of production and labor power . The Neural Network, in fact, resembles aspects of labor power. Just as workers gain more experience and improve their productivity, so machines improve their productivity through ‘self-learning’. In both cases, workers and machines have increased their use-value and their exchange-value in the marketplace. Marx’s duality between means of production and labor-power—constant capital and variable capital—is not sufficient for us to fully understand the Neural Network, since it is a machine with characteristics of human labor-power. The Neural Network example helped us to dissect the complications of its binary segmentation and subsequently shape the deficiency in Marx’s theories of the production process. I propose that we impose the caveat that the means of production can produce surplus-value, and move to contain the infinite surplus-value generated by the Neural Network. In essence, we acknowledge that Marx’s theories lack a fluidity deserved by the Neural Network example and try to resolve the paradox of the creation of infinite surplus-value.

The surplus-value generated by the Neural Network, using Marx’s amortization technique over its production chain, spreads the surplus-value over the constituent production processes. While not a comprehensive solution, this amortization technique provides a viable first-step in containing the surplus-value created by the means of production. If we consider the Neural Network as its own level of abstraction, we can analyze the production chain of the Neural Network to use Marx’s amortization technique and attempt to explain how the surplus value is generated—without the contribution of labor-power. If something that is worth $100 lasts 100 days, then we must factor a $1 devaluation every day. Therefore, we amortize its value across its life-time . To facilitate our analysis of the surplus value resulting from the Neural Network, let us look at the accumulation of value by the production processes throughout history that led to its materialization. Let this be the Neural Network production chain: C[0]=>C[1]=>C[2]=>C[3]=>C[4]=>…=>C[n-1]=>C[n], where C[0] = diode, C[1] = transistor, C[2] = CPU, C[3] = operating system, C[4] = machine learning algorithms, and so on, until C[n] = Neural Network, in which there is surplus-value. Every commodity ‘C’ gets fed into a new production cycle to produce another use-value. Once we achieve a commodity like the Neural Network C[n], where there is a level of ‘automation’, we amortize the surplus value across the entire production chain. This means that the means of production of every individual production process will contribute some surplus-value, i.e. C[0]=>C[1] has surplus value, C[1]=>C[2] has surplus value, etc. This way, we can distribute the surplus-value arising from the Neural Network through to all individual production processes that make up the production chain of the Neural Network. Therefore, each production process will yield some surplus-value. We have shown that if we break down the barriers between constant capital and variable capital to create a better segmentation of the production process, then we can still use Marx’s conceptual framework to justify the surplus- value contributions by the means of production. 

In a world where constant capital could lead to surplus-value, the capitalists will exploit machines instead of workers, as technology becomes more efficient. When a commodity completes the production process, constant capital ‘c’ becomes ‘c + x’, where ‘x’ is the constant capital contribution to surplus-value, and variable capital ‘v’ becomes ‘v + s’. In sum, the new surplus-value expression is now ‘z = x + s’. In Marx’s framework, the rate of surplus value is equal to the rate of exploitation, which is ‘s / v’ . But, due to the ‘surplus means of production’ contributions, the rate of surplus value is ‘z / v’, which is now different than the rate of exploitation. The rate of surplus value, ‘(x + s) / v’, can be expressed as two separate parts—surplus labor and surplus means of production—which is (x / v) + (s / v). The rate of exploitation, just as Marx defined, is ‘s / v’, but we will call this the exploitation of labor power, and call ‘x / v’ the exploitation of means of production. Therefore, we have subdivided exploitation into two constituents, the exploitation of labor power and the exploitation of means of production. Since the goal of the capitalists is to increase the rate of surplus-value, they must either increase the exploitation of labor power or the exploitation of the means of production, or both. As technology becomes more efficient, there’s no limit to the increase of exploitation of means of production, whereas there is a finite limit—time, number of laborers, etc.—to the increase of the exploitation of labor power. We can conclude that as technology improves, the exploited class will no longer be the working class, since the amount of surplus value produced by labor-power will proportionally decrease and make up less of the entire sum of surplus-value. A greater proportion of surplus-value comes from the means of production, so the optimal way to generate profits will be to exploit the means of production, or exploitation of machines.

Marx’s definitions of constant capital and variable capital may be a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive framework for understanding the production processes of his time. However, the advent of self-learning structures—the Neural Network—challenges his theories. By assessing the Neural Network against Marx’s concepts, we have found that the means of production can not only provide surplus-value, but also—at times—infinite surplus-value. This paradox comes from the constant capital vs. variable capital segmentation. A Marxist response to this paradox is to amortize the surplus-value across the entire production chain, which merely scratches the surface of the objection that the means of production and labor power may not be mutually exclusive categories. As technology improves over time, a new class emerges consisting of machines, and will replace the laborers as the exploited class.
